# Crux

> Markdown-native, lazy-loading, multi-agent workspace.
> Every rule, every identity, every protocol lives in a plain text file.
> No runtime required to read or understand what the system is doing.

## Installation

### Quick start

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotlabshq/crux/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

### With options

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotlabshq/crux/main/scripts/install.sh | bash -s -- \
  --tool opencode
```

| Option | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `--agents` | Comma-separated agent IDs to install | all available |
| `--tool` | Target AI tool: `opencode` · `claude-code` · `cursor` · `all` | auto-detect |
| `--project` | Project name used during workspace initialisation | — |
| `--force` | Overwrite existing `.crux/` files | false |
| `--dry-run` | Preview without writing files | false |

### After install

Start your AI tool in the project directory. The install script places the framework under `.crux/`. On first launch, the coordinator runs workspace initialisation and onboarding to generate project-specific files from user answers.

```
@kubernetes-admin   cluster health, namespaces, tenant provisioning
@postgresql-admin   schema inspection, roles, backups, tenant provisioning
```

### Keeping agents in sync

After editing any `.crux/agents/` or `.crux/skills/` file, re-run:

```sh
./scripts/convert.sh
```

This syncs agent and skill definitions to tool-specific locations (`.opencode/agent/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.cursor/rules/`).

### Updating from the Crux repo

To pull the latest agent, skill, and framework files from the upstream Crux repo:

```sh
./scripts/update.sh
```

This overwrites `.crux/agents/`, `.crux/skills/`, and framework files with the latest versions, then re-runs `convert.sh`. Local customisations to those files will be lost — commit them first if you want to preserve them.

```sh
# Update specific agents only
./scripts/update.sh --agents kubernetes-admin,postgresql-admin

# Preview without writing
./scripts/update.sh --dry-run
```

## Directory Structure

This section describes the installed runtime shape inside a user project.
If you are working on the Crux framework repository itself, see [docs/source-layout.md](docs/source-layout.md) for source-layout vs installed-layout rules.

## Context Loading Order

Every agent loads files in this order:

```
1. .crux/CONSTITUTION.md                    ~1000 tokens   always
2. .crux/SOUL.md                            ~500  tokens   always
3. .crux/agents/{role}/AGENT.md             ~800  tokens   always
4. .crux/workspace/{role}/MEMORY.md         ~400  tokens   always
5. .crux/workspace/{role}/TODO.md           ~300  tokens   always
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Base cost:                                  ~3000 tokens

6. .crux/workspace/{role}/NOTES.md          session start  supporting context for open tasks
7. .crux/summaries/{doc}.md                 on demand      overview sufficient
8. .crux/docs/{doc}.md                      on demand      generate if missing, then load
9. .crux/decisions/{id}.md                  on demand      when decision is referenced
10. .crux/skills/{name}/SKILL.md            on trigger     unloaded after use
```

Coordinator additionally loads on workflow trigger:
```
.crux/workflows/{name}.md                   on trigger     unloaded after workflow completes
```

Hard limit: **8000 tokens** before execution begins.

## Three Layers

```
.crux/              static      who we are        committed, versioned
.crux/workspace/    dynamic     what we know      gitignored, live state
.crux/workspace/sessions/ ephemeral   what coord did    gitignored, coordinator sessions
.crux/workspace/{role}/sessions/ ephemeral  what agents did   gitignored, per-agent sessions
```

---

## Onboarding Flow

When an agent starts and `.crux/workspace/MANIFEST.md` shows `status: pending-onboard`:

```
1. Run environment discovery (silent checks)
2. Ask user only what could not be discovered
3. Generate missing `.crux/docs/` references from the agent's assets if needed
4. Run required skills → generate project docs, decisions, or notes-root content
5. Write facts to `.crux/workspace/{role}/MEMORY.md`
6. Create `.crux/workspace/{role}/NOTES.md` from template
7. Update `.crux/workspace/MANIFEST.md` status → onboarded
8. Broadcast agent.onboarded event
```

---

## Workflow Flow

When the coordinator detects a workflow trigger phrase:

```
1. Load .crux/workflows/{name}.md
2. Collect inputs from user (one at a time, validate before proceeding)
3. For each step:
     a. Check owning agent is onboarded (`.crux/workspace/MANIFEST.md` status == onboarded)
        not onboarded + required: yes  → stop
        not onboarded + required: no   → skip, continue
     b. Check coordinator and agent `TODO.md` for an existing open task matching this step
     c. Delegate to agent via @mention, passing inputs
     d. Treat completion as `TODO.md` status = `done`, not merely "agent replied"
     e. Record step result in `.crux/workspace/sessions/{id}/scratch.md`
4. Coordinator runs Finalise: update `.crux/workspace/MANIFEST.md`, broadcast event, notify user
5. On required step failure → run rollback as defined in workflow file
```

---

## Task State Model

Crux separates task state from notes:

- `.crux/workspace/TODO.md` = coordinator source of truth for task continuity
- `.crux/workspace/{role}/TODO.md` = agent source of truth for task continuity
- `.crux/workspace/{role}/NOTES.md` = supporting context, discoveries, and workarounds
- `.crux/workspace/inbox.md` = human approvals and operator decisions
- `.crux/workspace/MANIFEST.md` = system summary

Agents and coordinator should:
- read `TODO.md` before starting new work
- reuse a matching open task instead of silently starting over
- update task status before and after meaningful execution
- use `done`, `waiting`, `blocked`, or `canceled` explicitly at session end

---

## Amendment Flow

```
1. Agent writes AMD-{id} to `.crux/workspace/MANIFEST.md` → Pending Amendments
2. Agent pauses and notifies user
3. User approves → .crux/CONSTITUTION.md updated, version incremented
4. User rejects → agent continues under current rule
```

---

## @Mention Modes

| Mode | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `primary` | Direct handoff in same context (Tab switcher) |
| `subagent` | Invoked via @mention or by primary agent |

---

## .gitignore

```
.crux/workspace/
```

Everything under `.crux/workspace/` is gitignored. All static `.crux/` files are committed.
Generated `.crux/docs/`, `decisions/`, project `docs/`, and any user-selected notes root are created during onboarding or lazy-loading, not pre-populated in the repo.

---

## Adding Agents, Skills, and Workflows

```
Agent:    copy templates/AGENT.template.md      → agents/{role}/AGENT.md
          copy templates/onboarding.template.md → agents/{role}/onboarding.md
          add agent-local assets under          → agents/{role}/assets/   (if the agent generates `.crux/docs/*`)
          run: ./scripts/convert.sh

Skill:    copy templates/SKILL.template.md      → skills/{name}/SKILL.md
          run: ./scripts/convert.sh

Workflow: copy templates/WORKFLOW.template.md   → workflows/{name}.md
          update `.crux/workspace/MANIFEST.md` Workflows table
```

## Three-Layer Model

| Concept | Where | Scope | Git |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Skill** | `skills/{name}/SKILL.md` | One agent, one task | ✓ |
| **Workflow** | `workflows/{name}.md` | Coordinator + multiple agents | ✓ |
| **Decision** | `decisions/{id}.md` | Human-approved, permanent record | ✓ |
| **Doc** | `docs/{topic}.md` | Generated knowledge, replaceable | ✓ |
| **Memory** | `.crux/workspace/{role}/MEMORY.md` | Agent runtime state | ✗ |
## Source vs Installed

Crux keeps a strict separation between framework source and project runtime:

- Source repo layout is for framework development only.
- Installed layout is the only valid runtime/documentation model.
- All architecture documents must reference installed paths.
- Install script maps source layout into installed `.crux/`.
- Generated docs, summaries, workspace, and user outputs must never be committed as source framework content.

See [docs/source-layout.md](docs/source-layout.md) for the explicit mapping table and generation rules.
